This is ASP.NET MVC Library Application. 
I've used Visual Studio 2015 Enterprise to inplement this app & MS SQL Server & ADO.NET for database integration.
So to run this app you need to have Windows OS and a couple of frameworks you usually need using ASP.NET MVC.
You can find database files and its detached backup in \LibraryApplication\LibraryApplication\App_Data\
There are three "roles" available in library application. Here's login data:
1. Unregistered user (no data needed)
2. Reader (e-mail: vanishrap@gmail.com, name: Vlad) 
	Of course there are more users, but I want you to test this one, because I want to get an e-mail notification from my app when you run it.
3. Admin (e-mail: Administrator, name: Administrator) 
User guide is an html page and it'll be available by clicking link "Help" at the bottom of every page.
But if my project won't even start, there will be no need in any further information that user guide can provide.
Good luck!
